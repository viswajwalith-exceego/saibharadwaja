Ekkirala Alivelu Mangatayaru</b>) lovingly called as 'Ammagaru' is born in Mannava village of Guntur district in Andhra Pradesh. Her parents Sri Mannava Balakrishna Sarma & Smt. Ranganayakamma hail from a traditionally devoted family. They named her after a 
                    goddess as 'Alivelu Manga Tayaru'. Ammagaru is the 6th child in the family of 6 girls and 2 brothers.
                    <br /><br />
                She is married to Parama Pujya Acharya Sri Ekkirala Bharadwaja, on 6 March 1975. It happened that she was taken to Jillellamudi, the village where Matrusri Jillellamudi Amma a well known spiritual stallwart was residing. There was an ashram there and Ammagaru used to offer seva. She was so much into devotion, she even refused to visit her father's last rites. In the course of time, Sri Ekkirala Bharadwaja 
                        stayed at the ashram for an year in the presence of Jillellamudi Amma. During this period of time, Sri Ekkirala Bharadwaja was asked to get into Gruhasta Ashrama (akin to Married Life), and he chose Alivelumangamma to be his bride. 
                        Upon the approval from both families the marriage took place at Banaganapalli Village, where Alivelu mangamma's elder brother used to work as a officer in ILTD.
                       <br /><br /> It is now, 2025, the 50th marriage anniversary of the divine marriage. It is been celebrated as 'Kalyana Mahotsavamu' with great reverence and joy, in many towns.
                    <br /><br />Pujya Ammagaru took Samadhi on 3 June, 2021 in Hyderabad. Her Samadhi mandir was built in Gummalampadu Village, near Ongole town in AP state. Several devotees are doing Seva and getting spiritual upliftment. Many leelas are happening and devotees are
                        benifited by getting saved from many problems of daily material lives. All one has to offer is simple devotion in a prescribed way of doing seva and parayana. More striking thing is that,
                       Ammagaru is showing her divine presence of love towards the devotees in myriad times in magnitude than when she was 
                       in physical Avatar. No one is going back unanswered, that is the unique feature of Pujya Master and now also at the abode of Pujya Ammagaru.
