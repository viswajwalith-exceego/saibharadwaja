            <b>Smt. Ekkirala Alivelu Mangatayaru</b>) lovingly called as 'Ammagaru' is born in Mannava village of
            Guntur district in Andhra Pradesh. Her parents Sri Mannava Balakrishna Sarma & Smt. Ranganayakamma hail
            from a traditionally devoted family. They named her after a goddess as 'Alivelu Manga Tayaru'. Ammagaru is
            the 6th child in the family of 6 girls and 2 brothers.
            <br />
            <br />
            She is married to Parama Pujya Acharya Sri Ekkirala Bharadwaja, on 6 March 1975. It happened that she was
            taken to Jillellamudi, the village where Matrusri Jillellamudi Amma a well known spiritual stallwart was
            residing. There was an ashram there and Ammagaru used to offer seva. She was so much into devotion, she even
            refused to visit her father's last rites. In the course of time, Sri Ekkirala Bharadwaja stayed at the
            ashram for an year in the presence of Jillellamudi Amma. During this period of time, Sri Ekkirala Bharadwaja
            was asked to get into Gruhasta Ashrama (akin to Married Life), and he chose Alivelumangamma to be his bride.
            Upon the approval from both families the marriage took place at Banaganapalli Village, where Alivelu
            mangamma's elder brother used to work as a officer in ILTD.
            <br />
            <br /> It is now, 2025, the 50th marriage anniversary of the divine marriage. It is been celebrated as
            'Kalyana Mahotsavamu' with great reverence and joy, in many towns.
            <br />
            <br />
            Pujya Ammagaru took Samadhi on 3 June, 2021 in Hyderabad. Her Samadhi mandir was built in Gummalampadu
            Village, near Ongole town in AP state. Several devotees are doing Seva and getting spiritual upliftment. Many
            leelas are happening and devotees are benifited by getting saved from many problems of daily material lives.
            All one has to offer is simple devotion in a prescribed way of doing seva and parayana. More striking thing
            is that, Ammagaru is showing her divine presence of love towards the devotees in myriad times in magnitude
            than when she was in physical Avatar. No one is going back unanswered, that is the unique feature of Pujya
            Master and now also at the abode of Pujya Ammagaru.
